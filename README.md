Below is a high-level flowchart of your system, broken into two main phases: offline preprocessing (steps 1–4) and runtime voice control (step 5). You can copy & paste the Mermaid code into any Markdown editor that supports Mermaid to render the diagram.

  subgraph Offline Preprocessing
    A1[Start] --> A2[Scan directory for PPT files]
    A2 --> A3[Assign unique IDs & map file paths]
    A3 --> A4[Loop over each PPT]
    A4 --> A5[Extract each slide’s contents]
    A5 --> A6[Parse out text, images & keywords]
    A6 --> A7[Build slide metadata (slide# ↔ keywords)]
    A7 --> A8[Generate terminal-style command sequences]
    A8 --> A9[Store command map for each PPT]
  end

  subgraph Runtime Voice Control
    B1[Await user voice input] --> B2[Convert voice to text]
    B2 --> B3[Feed text into LLM]
    B3 --> B4[LLM outputs a PPT command]
    B4 --> B5[Execute command on target PPT]
    B5 --> B6[Presentation updates (e.g. go to slide X)]
    B6 --> B1
  end

  A9 --> B1

Explanation of the blocks:
	1.	Scan directory for PPTs
	•	Look in a specified folder (or set of folders) and list all PowerPoint files.
	2.	Assign unique IDs & map file paths
	•	Give each file a distinct identifier (e.g. PPT1, PPT2) and record its name/location.
	3.	Extract & index slide contents
	•	For each PPT, pull out each slide’s text, images, and automatically extract keywords.
	4.	Generate terminal-style sequences
	•	Precompute the exact commands you’ll need (e.g. open PPT1, goto slide 3) and store them in a lookup table keyed by keywords or slide number.
	5.	Voice control loop
	•	Voice → Text: Use a speech-to-text engine.
	•	Text → Command: Feed the transcription into a trained LLM which maps phrases like “next slide” or “show me slide five” into one of your precomputed terminal commands.
	•	Execute & Update: Run the command on your presentation engine and display the requested slide.

This two-phase design keeps the heavy lifting offline, so at runtime the system is just converting speech to text, mapping to a command, and executing it. Let me know if you need any adjustments or more detailed breakdowns!
